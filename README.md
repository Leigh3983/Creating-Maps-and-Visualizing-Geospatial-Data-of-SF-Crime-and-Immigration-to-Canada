### Creating-Maps-and-Visualizing-Geospatial-Data-of-SF-Crime-and-Immigration-to-Canada

In these projects, I use the Python library, Folium, to create interactive world maps. 

In th first project, I depict different types of crime around SF, accoording to data collected from the public of SF. I use various types of markers and clusters of the markers to represent different types of crime in specific locations of SF according to their longitude and latitude. 

In th second project, I depict the variation of immmigration intensity from countries all around the world to Canada during the years of 1980-2013. I create a Choropleth map to convey the varying intensity of immigration according to the darkness of the colors of each country. I discover that China and India have the highest numbers of immigrants to Canada during this time period, with the Phillipines following close behind.

### Creating-Maps-and-Visualizing-Geospatial-Data-of-SF-Crime-and-Immigration-to-Canada

In these projects, I use the Python library, Folium, to create interactive world maps. 

In th first project, I depict different types of crime around San Francisco, accoording to data collected for thee year 2016 from the San Francisco public data portalS which uses data from the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) Crime Incident Reporting system. I use various types of markers and clusters of the markers to represent different types of crime in specific locations of SF according to their longitude and latitude. 

In the second project, I depict international migration flows from countries all around the world to Canada during the years of 1980-2013. I create a Choropleth map to convey the varying intensity of immigration according to the darkness of the colors of each country. I discover that China and India have the highest numbers of immigrants to Canada during this time period, with the Phillipines following close behind.
